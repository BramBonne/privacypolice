    <string name="location_permission_full_explanation">Starting with Android version 5.0 (Lollipop), apps can only view the list of Wi-Fi networks that are in range while location access is enabled. Your mileage may vary (depending on the device you\'re using, this might not be the case), but if you experience problems when using Wi-Fi PrivacyPolice, consider enabling location access. Coarse location access (only using Wi-Fi networks and cell towers, and not your actual GPS chip) should be sufficient.</string>
